# The Arios RuneScape Private Server 530 Revision.

This is the Arios 498 revision. Started back in 2012 by me and Emperor (https://forum.runelocus.com/topic/79505-arios-498-reliving-the-good-times/).

This project is a complete remake of RuneScape capturing every piece of content in the free-to-play version of RuneScape back in 2009. Includes a plethora of member content.

Arios was converted to fit the RuneScape client revision 530. Content was adjusted accordinly.
